The SEPTA Metro "G" Line, formerly Route 15, is a trolley/bus line making stops (mostly) along Girard Avenue. 

Sometimes riders get a normal SEPTA bus, but other times, they get a glorious vintage PCC trolley car!

This app tracks the PCC trolleys only so that you can easily make a plan to ride one. 

Simply select your origin SEPTA metro or regional rail stop and have fun, fellow trolley rider!
